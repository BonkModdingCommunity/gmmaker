# Game Mode Maker Legacy

GMMaker Legacy is a special edition of GMMaker that builds off v0.9.8, giving it a modernized UI and a couple extra features. It was made to allow people to play and edit game modes made before v1.0.0 with ease.

To download GMMaker Legacy, just find the latest entry in [Releases](https://github.com/SneezingCactus/gmmaker/releases) that contains "Legacy" in its title. The installation process is the same as normal GMMaker, just make sure not to have both editions of GMMaker enabled at the same time!
